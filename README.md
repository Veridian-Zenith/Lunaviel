# Lunaviel Core

> A wave-harmonized kernel optimized for Intel i3-1215U architecture, introducing novel resource management through resonance patterns and wave mechanics

## Overview

Lunaviel Core is an innovative operating system kernel that introduces wave harmonization for resource management and system optimization. Built specifically for the Intel i3-1215U processor, it leverages the hybrid architecture (2P + 4E cores) to achieve optimal performance through resonance-based resource allocation.

The kernel's unique wave-based approach allows for:
- Dynamic resource harmonization across P and E cores
- Cache-coherent wave patterns for optimal memory access
- Resonant I/O operations with adaptive flow control
- Wave-synchronized driver interactions
- Harmonic process scheduling

## Key Features

- **Wave Harmonization**: Novel approach to resource management using wave mechanics principles
- **Hybrid Core Optimization**: Specialized for Intel i3-1215U's performance and efficiency cores
- **Adaptive Resource Management**: Dynamic resource allocation based on system resonance
- **Cache-Aware Design**: Optimized for the i3-1215U's cache hierarchy
- **Wave-Based Driver Architecture**: Unified driver framework with resonance tracking
- **Resonant I/O System**: Flow-controlled I/O operations with wave synchronization

## System Requirements

- **CPU**: Intel i3-1215U (2P + 4E cores, 8 threads)
- **Memory**: 8GB minimum, 16GB recommended
- **Storage**: NVMe SSD recommended for optimal wave harmonization
- **Platform**: UEFI-compatible system

## Quick Start

### Building from Source

```fish
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Veridian-Zenith/Lunaviel.git
cd Lunaviel

# Build the kernel
./Lunaviel-Core/scripts/build.fish

# Run in QEMU
./scripts/run-qemu.fish
```

### Development Environment

Required tools:
- Zig 0.11.0 or later
- NASM 2.15.05 or later
- QEMU 7.0.0 or later

## Architecture

Lunaviel Core is organized into several subsystems:

- **Aether**: Boot sequence and core initialization
- **Memoria**: Memory management and cache optimization
- **Sylph**: Task scheduling and thread management
- **Astral**: System calls and userspace interface
- **Seer**: Monitoring and diagnostics

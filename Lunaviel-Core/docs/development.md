# Development Guide

## Overview
This guide covers the development process and best practices for contributing to Lunaviel Core.

## Getting Started

### Environment Setup
1. Install required tools:
   - Zig 0.11.0 or later
   - NASM 2.15.05 or later
   - QEMU 7.0.0 or later

2. Clone the repository:
   ```fish
   git clone https://github.com/Veridian-Zenith/Lunaviel.git
   cd Lunaviel
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```fish
   ./Lunaviel-Core/scripts/build.fish
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Branch Management
- Create feature branches from `main`
- Use descriptive branch names
- Keep changes focused and atomic

### Code Style
- Follow Zig standard library conventions
- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Keep lines under 100 characters
- Document public interfaces

### Testing
- Write unit tests for new features
- Include wave harmonization tests
- Verify cache optimization
- Test on target hardware

## Wave Harmonization Development

### Wave Pattern Design
- Consider resonance impacts
- Document wave characteristics
- Test harmonization effects

### Resource Management
- Monitor cache utilization
- Track power efficiency
- Optimize core usage

### Performance Testing
- Measure wave patterns
- Track resonance stability
- Monitor cache efficiency
- Log power consumption

## Debug and Profiling

### Debug Tools
- Use QEMU debugging features
- Monitor wave patterns
- Track resource usage
- Analyze cache behavior

### Performance Analysis
- Use built-in profilers
- Monitor wave resonance
- Track cache efficiency
- Analyze power usage

## Best Practices

### Code Organization
- Keep modules focused
- Document dependencies
- Consider wave impacts
- Maintain API stability

### Documentation
- Document public interfaces
- Include wave analysis
- Provide examples
- Keep docs current

### Error Handling
- Use meaningful errors
- Document error conditions
- Provide recovery paths
- Consider wave stability

## Release Process

### Version Management
- Follow semantic versioning
- Document changes clearly
- Test thoroughly
- Update documentation

### Release Steps
1. Update version numbers
2. Run full test suite
3. Update documentation
4. Create release notes
5. Tag release
6. Build release artifacts
